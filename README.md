# pear-react-whiteboard
A minimal P2P whiteboard app based on Pear runtime based on the customized build of [Whiteboard SDK](http://npmjs.com/package/@baasi/whiteboard) I built a while ago

# Running the project
1) `npm i -g pear`
2) `npm install`
3) `npm run dev`

# Usage
I suggest running two instances of the app to test P2P connection

Click on the **Create a Room** button in the first instance and copy the generated token

Paste it in the second instance input, then click **Join**

Now you can start drawing

You can press CTRL Z to undo your drawing actions
